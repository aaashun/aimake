aimake is a mini building tool based on gnu make. it's easy to cross compile shared library or static library for ios and android. 

it's green, you don't need to install it

1. requirements:
    (1) gnu make, aimake was based on gnu make
    (2) [optional] ios sdk, it's required if you need to build your project for ios 
    (3) [optional] android ndk, it's required if you need to build your project for android

2. how to use aimake?
    (1) copy 'aimakefile' to your project folder
    (2) modify variables in aimakfile for your compilation requirement
    (4) run 'aimake' (aimake is a soft link pointing to aimake.sh)

3. how to support more target platforms
    the sub-folder(ios, android) means supported target platform,  and the name of sub-folder is some as target platform's name.
    Every sub-folder must contains the following files:
        init.mk                 -- initialize variables of compilation environment, e.g. CC, CXX, CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS
        build_executable.mk     -- specify that compile the project into executable
        build_static_library.mk -- specify that compile the project into static library
        build_shared_library.mk -- specify that compile the project into shared library
        build_all.mk            -- contains explicit rules and goals for gnu make

just enjoy it
